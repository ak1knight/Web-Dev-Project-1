    <h1>The National Championship Game</h1>

    <h2>Alabama vs. Clemson</h2>

    <a href="http://www.espn.com/college-football/game?gameId=400876570"> <img src="images/hobbyheader.jpg" alt="Bo Scarbrough faces off against Deshaun Watson" /> </a>

    <h3>Quarter 1</h3>

    <p>Alabama started fast in the first quarter, scoring just 5 minutes into the game on a 25 yard run by star running back <a href="http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/3126367/bo-scarbrough">Bo Scarbrough</a>. Meanwhile, Clemson struggled
        to move the ball against Alabama's stout defense and 2-time Heisman Trophy finalist quarterback <a href="http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/3122840/deshaun-watson">Deshaun Watson</a> looked flustered by a relentless Alabama pass
        rush. Clemson's defense toughened up the rest of the quarter, however, and the teams finished the first 15 minute period with the Crimson Tide leading 7-0</p>

    <h3>Quarter 2</h3>

    <p>The second quarter started very similar to the first. Following a punt by Clemson, Alabama drove 74 yards in just 5 plays, capped off by a 37 yard touchdown run by Bo Scarbrough, his second of the game. This put the Tide up 14-0, a lead that Alabama
        has not blown since head coach Nick Saban was hired in 2007. Clemson was not phased by history or momentum however, and following a punt by both teams, quarterback Deshaun Watson had two big pass completions before running 8 yards himself to score
        Clemson's first points of the game, capping a 7 play, 87 yard drive. The teams took the 14-7 score into halftime.</p>

    <h3>Quarter 3</h3>

    <p>The third quarter again started poorly for Clemson. Tiger running back <a href="http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/546633/wayne-gallman">Wayne Gallman</a> fumbled the ball in Clemson territory on their opening drive and Alabama converted
        the blunder into a field goal, bringing the Tide's lead back to 10. Again, though, Clemson would respond. After a poor punt gave the Tigers great field position, Deshaun Watson orchestrated another quick touchdown drive, finishing with a 24 yard
        pass to reciever <a href="http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/3135321/hunter-renfrow">Hunter Renfrow</a> to bring the Tigers within 3. Alabama struck back after a busted coverage from the Clemson secondary left tight end <a href="http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/546370/oj-howard">O.J. Howard</a>        wide open for a 68 yard touchdown pass. The quarter ended with the Tide nursing a 10 point advantage, 24-14.</p>

    <h3>Quarter 4</h3>

    <p>Clemson started the fourth quarter with a bang, responding to the O.J. Howard touchdown that ended the fourth quarter with a touchdown of their own, driving methodically down the field and scoring with a 4 yard pass to star reciever <a href="http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/546644/mike-williams">Mike Williams</a>.
        The Tigers later took the lead after a Wayne Gallman touchdown run capped a 88 yard drive. Down 28-24, the Tide struck back a couple of plays later, with freshman quarterback <a href="http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4040715/jalen-hurts">Jalen Hurts</a>        running 30 yards for a touchdown with just 2 minutes remaining in the game. With likely just one drive left, it was do or die time for Deshaun Watson and Clemson. The drive started well, with Mike Williams showing off his height in coming down
        with a 17 yard catch to put the Tigers into Alabama territory. A pass to reciever <a href="http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/546740/jordan-leggett">Jordan Leggett</a> brought Clemson down to the 9 yard line with just 20 seconds
        left on the clock, and a pass interference call on Alabama's <a href="http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/551289/anthony-averett">Anthony Averett</a> put the ball on the 2 yard line with 6 seconds to go. Clemson opted to take one
        more shot at the end zone instead of kicking the tying field goal. Deshaun Watson rolled to his right and found an open Hunter Renfrow 1 yard deep in the endzone to score the go ahead touchdown with just 1 second on the clock. Following a Clemson
        onside kick and kneel down, the Tigers won the national title over Alabama, 35-31.</p>
