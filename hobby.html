            <h3>Quarter 1</h3>
            <p>Alabama started fast in the first quarter, scoring just 5 minutes into the game on a 25 yard run by star running
                back <a href="http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/3126367/bo-scarbrough">Bo Scarbrough</a>.
                Meanwhile, Clemson struggled to move the ball against Alabama's stout defense and 2-time Heisman Trophy finalist
                quarterback <a href="http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/3122840/deshaun-watson">Deshaun Watson</a>                looked flustered by a relentless Alabama pass rush. Clemson's defense toughened up the rest of the quarter,
                however, and the teams finished the first 15 minute period with the Crimson Tide leading 7-0</p>

            <h3>Quarter 2</h3>
            <p>The second quarter started very similar to the first. Following a punt by Clemson, Alabama drove 74 yards in
                just 5 plays, capped off by a 37 yard touchdown run by Bo Scarbrough, his second of the game. This put the
                Tide up 14-0, a lead that Alabama has not blown since head coach Nick Saban was hired in 2007. Clemson was
                not phased by history or momentum however, and following a punt by both teams, quarterback Deshaun Watson
                had two big pass completions before running 8 yards himself to score Clemson's first points of the game,
                capping a 7 play, 87 yard drive. The teams took the 14-7 score into halftime.</p>

            <h3>Quarter 3</h3>
            <p>The third quarter again started poorly for Clemson. Tiger running back <a href="http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/546633/wayne-gallman">Wayne Gallman</a>                fumbled the ball in Clemson territory on their opening drive and Alabama converted the blunder into a field
                goal, bringing the Tide's lead back to 10. Again, though, Clemson would respond. After a poor punt gave the
                Tigers great field position, Deshaun Watson orchestrated another quick touchdown drive, finishing with a
                24 yard pass to reciever <a href="http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/3135321/hunter-renfrow">Hunter Renfrow</a>                to bring the Tigers within 3. Alabama struck back after a busted coverage from the Clemson secondary left
                tight end
                <a href="http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/546370/oj-howard">O.J. Howard</a> wide open for
                a 68 yard touchdown pass. The quarter ended with the Tide nursing a 10 point advantage, 24-14.</p>

                /></div>
            <h3>Quarter 4</h3>
            <p>Clemson started the fourth quarter with a bang, responding to the O.J. Howard touchdown that ended the fourth
                quarter with a touchdown of their own, driving methodically down the field and scoring with a 4 yard pass
                to star reciever <a href="http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/546644/mike-williams">Mike Williams</a>.
                The Tigers later took the lead after a Wayne Gallman touchdown run capped a 88 yard drive. Down 28-24, the
                Tide struck back a couple of plays later, with freshman quarterback <a href="http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4040715/jalen-hurts">Jalen Hurts</a>                running 30 yards for a touchdown with just 2 minutes remaining in the game. With likely just one drive left,
                it was do or die time for Deshaun Watson and Clemson. The drive started well, with Mike Williams showing
                off his height in coming down with a 17 yard catch to put the Tigers into Alabama territory. A pass to reciever
                <a href="http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/546740/jordan-leggett">Jordan Leggett</a> brought
                Clemson down to the 9 yard line with just 20 seconds left on the clock, and a pass interference call on Alabama's
                <a href="http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/551289/anthony-averett">Anthony Averett</a> put
                the ball on the 2 yard line with 6 seconds to go. Clemson opted to take one more shot at the end zone instead
                of kicking the tying field goal. Deshaun Watson rolled to his right and found an open Hunter Renfrow 1 yard
                deep in the endzone to score the go ahead touchdown with just 1 second on the clock. Following a Clemson
                onside kick and kneel down, the Tigers won the national title over Alabama, 35-31.</p>
