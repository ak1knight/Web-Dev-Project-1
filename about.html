                <p class="rightColumn">Hello, my name is Alex Knight and you've happened upon my website. This page is all about me, what I like to do, what I'm studying, and where I'm working. I'm from Salt Lake City, where I'm currently living. I have 5 little brothers, so a big family I suppose. My hobbies include everything from sports to video games. I also really enjoy pretty much everything about computers. I've built my own computers, have multiple IT certifications, and have done some programming.</p>

                <p class="rightColumn">Currently I'm a Computer Science major at Weber State University. I graduated from West High School in Salt Lake City in 2010. Following graduation I went on a 2 year LDS mission and upon returning I enrolled at Salt Lake Community College. In 2016 I recieved my A.S. in Computer Science and Information Systems from SLCC.</p>

                    <p>As part of my work, I've had the opportunity to participate in many projects that have been great learning experiences for me. I work as a data analyst for a healthcare consulting company. This has given me the chance to learn not only about specifics of the healthcare market in the United States, but also general learning about the data analysis process and working in an office environment. This has given me a great foundation of skills that, when combined with a strong education, I hope to springboard into a successful career.</p>
