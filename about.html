                <h1>Personal Life</h1>
                <p>As part of my work, I've had the opportunity to participate in many projects that have been great learning experiences for me. I work as a data analyst for a healthcare consulting company. This has given me the chance to learn not only about specifics of the healthcare market in the United States, but also general learning about the data analysis process and working in an office environment. This has given me a great foundation of skills that, when combined with a strong education, I hope to springboard into a successful career.</p>
