(paragraph)
A movie that added a new definition to the word "inception" for an entire generation, this is one you can watch again and again. Everything from the story to the acting to the music are all well done and add to the suspense and intrigue of the film.

(paragraph)
One of the tear-jerkers on this list, this film follows a guy named Gregg as he and his friend Earl befriend a girl from their school who was diagnosed with cancer. While the general plot could easily be lifted from a sappy Hallmark movie, this film manages to capture the emotion and realities of dealing with major illness while also managing to have a fun, quirky side.

(list item) The Dark Knight (medium-header)

(paragraph)
The opening bank robbery scene of this film perfectly encompasses why it earns the spot on this list. The intensity and utter disregard for the "rules" of super hero flicks displayed in this scene pulsed throughout the entire film, creating a roller coaster ride of a movie that both exhilarates and exhausts.

(list item) WALL-E (medium-header)

(image "images/walle.jpg" description:Robot Wall-E looks at a Rubik's cube) (link url:"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0910970/")

(paragraph)
While many Pixar movies could have occupied this spot, Wall-E earns it by being different. Having two protaganists who don't say much more than their own names is risky, but this film not only pulls it off, it manages to create a love story the emotional impact of which meets or exceeds that of other films with vocal main characters; and who doesn't love a cute romantic dance scene in space?

(list item) Interstellar (medium-header)

(image "images/interstellar.jpg" description:Matthew McConaughey as Cooper in Interstellar) (link url:"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0816692/")

(paragraph)
A film that is as thought-provoking as it is awe-inspiring, Interstellar manages to weave science and emotion into a beatiful package. Intense scenes like escaping from a super-massive planet covered in water are juxtaposed with a heartbreaking scene of Cooper realizing he's missed decades of his kid's lives in what felt like a couple hours. A film that needs to be experienced.
